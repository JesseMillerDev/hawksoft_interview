# Here is my test app

I wanted to explain the decisions that I made in completing the exercise that you gave me. I realize that this solution is both unconventional and significantly bloated and overkill and for that I apologize.
    When I read that I could choose any UI framework I wanted and that JS was not specified I knew I had to use Blazor. First because I think it is an awesome technology and I love writing C# in the front end but
    also as a way to show my attitude of continual learning and self-improvement. As new technologies come out I try very hard to keep up to date and at least familiarize myself with them. All that being said I 
    could have made this app significantly simpler using the base starter template but A) That is boring and B) If I were to create a blazor app for production I would start with something like this boilerplate app 
    instead of the built in template that Blazor provides because it includes quite a few of the standard patterns that I would be implementing anyways. I ended up ripping out <b>large</b> amounts of code to make
    it easier to grok but I know it is still probably too much. I hope you can see what I have done though and even more that you can compile and run it. It has a fully implemeneted Identity service meaning you can
    create users and those users will have their own contacts attatched to them. It also uses sql with a code first EF migration setup. I hope you enjoy this and whether we continue forward with the process or not
    I had a ton of fun making this for you guys.

    P.S. I left the original template home page in tact in the about section so you can see everything that it includes.
